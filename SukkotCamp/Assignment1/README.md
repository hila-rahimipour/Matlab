#Assignment 1

The program loads information from StrokeData file and creats a graph of the results in 2 exams. people with stroke are in blue and people without stroke are in red.
The program calls GradientDecent function that finds the error rate by "cost function". It runs until it reaches the max iteration number or reaches the error goal.
It also displays the change in the error rate over a graph and a linear classification line.

Then, the program calculates if a person is having a stroke or not and compares it with the existing data. It calaculates the error percentage.
